Dear Mary,

     Thanks for your last letter. <em>I'm so glad</em> that you have been able (at

             last! ) to arrange a holiday in Australia. As I fear I won't be

     able to meet you at the airport when you arrive, nor will I be able to be

     home until later in the afternoon, so here are some instructions and

     suggestions.
</p>
<h2>
destination
</h2>
<p>
There is a bus from the airport to the <em>city</em>. It is much cheaper than a

     cab. Take the bus to the city and ask to get off at Town Hall railway

     station.
</p>
<p>
To get to my place in the eastern suburbs you have three options. You can

     either take a cab, a bus or the train. I suggest you take the train,

     since the airport bus will leave you right at the station. Get off at

     Cliff Station. From there you can either walk to my place (about ten

             minutes) or take a taxi. Probably you should take a taxi as you

     will have luggage.

          When you arrive at my flat, ring the intercom for Flat 2. My friend

          Lillian will be at home and she will open the front door for you and

          let you into my flat.
</p>
<p>
Presumably you will be tired and want to sleep. But if you feel like

          some exercise after that long flight, you could stroll down to

          Cooper Park, which is only ten minutes away ? you can see it from

          the window.
